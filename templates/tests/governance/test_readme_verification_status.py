"""Contract test — README production-readiness wording discipline (R5-H1).

Authority: ACTION_PLAN_R5 §R5-H1 + audit-r4 evidence policy.

R5-H1 called out that the README used the unqualified phrase
``"Production-ready"`` against every row of the maturity matrix without
drawing the distinction between:

1. Components the template PROVES in its own CI (contracts, scaffold,
   golden-path E2E).
2. Components an adopter must VERIFY in their own environment (L4
   production rollout on their cluster with their traffic).

The softened wording — ``"Production-ready by design"`` — plus a new
§"Verification status" mini-matrix with layers L1..L4 is the honest
statement. These invariants exist so a future edit cannot silently
revert to the unqualified claim without this test failing.

Invariants:

- The phrase ``"Production-ready"`` is ALWAYS followed by
  ``"by design"`` when it appears as a status tag in the maturity
  matrix. Standalone ``"Production-ready"`` is only allowed in
  narrative / prose contexts (quoted-term paragraph, section titles).
- The README has a §"Verification status" section.
- That section mentions all four layers: L1, L2, L3, L4.
- L4 explicitly states that adopter verification is not assertable
  from this repo (honesty anchor).
- The anti-pattern badge shield uses ``anti--patterns-32%20encoded``
  (R5-L1 + R5-H1 are co-shipped; the badge is the most prominent
  count claim on the page).
