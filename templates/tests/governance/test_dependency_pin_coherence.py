"""Contract — the pin-coherence gate catches the defect it was written for.

Why this exists
---------------
``scripts/check_dependency_pin_coherence.py`` passes on a clean tree, and
``test_gate_scope_ratchet.py`` already asserts that much. Passing on a clean
tree is exactly what the *broken* gates in this repository's history also did.
The question a control has to answer is the other one: **does it fail when the
thing it guards is wrong?**

So each test here reintroduces a specific real-world shape of the defect into a
throwaway copy of the repository layout, and asserts the gate rejects it —
naming the package, so the failure is actionable rather than a bare exit code.

The defect being guarded, for the record: ``templates/service/requirements.txt``
pinned ``scikit-learn ~= 1.5.0`` and ``pandera ~= 0.23.0`` while
``templates/service/eda/requirements.txt`` pinned ``~= 1.9`` and ``~= 0.33``.
``docs/TUTORIAL.md`` installs both into one environment in two separate
commands, so pip never reports the conflict — it silently upgrades. The adopter
trained against scikit-learn 1.9 and served from an image built with 1.5.2.
