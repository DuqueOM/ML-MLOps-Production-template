"""Contract test — NetworkPolicy egress hygiene (R5-M3, hardened by May 2026 MED-11).

Authority: ACTION_PLAN_R5 §R5-M3; May 2026 audit MED-11.

Since MED-11 the base NetworkPolicy at
``templates/service/k8s/base/networkpolicy.yaml`` ships ZERO public egress
(default-deny). Defense-in-depth must fail closed: when an overlay
forgets its patch, the init container cannot reach cloud storage and
the rollout fails visibly instead of running with a wildcard egress.

EVERY overlay therefore MUST apply a JSON 6902 patch at
``patch-networkpolicy.yaml``:

- ``gcp-dev`` / ``aws-dev`` apply a deliberately permissive rule so
  ``kustomize build overlays/<cloud>-dev`` works out of the box;
- ``gcp-staging``/``gcp-prod``/``aws-staging``/``aws-prod`` apply
  cloud-specific allowlists and MUST NOT contain ``0.0.0.0/0``.

This contract test enforces:

1. The base NetworkPolicy carries the ``OVERLAY-OVERRIDE REQUIRED``
   banner (with MED-11 provenance) so the intent is visible to any
   future editor.
2. Every overlay controls egress — the cloud x env ones by shipping
   ``patch-networkpolicy.yaml`` and wiring it into ``kustomization.yaml``
   with ``target.kind: NetworkPolicy``; ``batch-only`` by shipping its own
   NetworkPolicy, because the base's podSelector does not match the batch
   pod's label and so leaves it uncovered.
3. No active patch or policy body contains ``0.0.0.0/0`` outside dev.

The overlay list is DISCOVERED. It used to be a literal six, which was the
right count for the patch-based overlays and the wrong count for the tree:
``batch-only`` was referenced by no test in this repository at all, while
shipping a real egress control.

The test parses YAML structurally; it does not require kustomize in
the test environment. An additional optional check invokes
``kustomize build`` if available and fails when the rendered non-dev
output still contains ``0.0.0.0/0`` — that catches patch-wiring
mistakes that the structural checks would miss (e.g., wrong
``target`` kind).
