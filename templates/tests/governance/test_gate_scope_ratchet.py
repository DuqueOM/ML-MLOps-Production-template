"""Contract — a gate may not quietly start checking less than it used to.

Why this exists
---------------
This repository relies on seventeen gates to detect its own drift, and **none of
them was tested**. `grep -rl "import scripts"` over both test trees returned
nothing. Every control that catches a regression could itself regress, silently.

That is not hypothetical. Twice in one week a gate narrowed and reported
success at its smaller size:

* ``check_control_claims.py`` scanned **36** anti-patterns instead of 38, after
  two table rows gained a Jinja ``raw`` wrapper that its row pattern no longer
  matched. It printed "OK — 5 of 36" and nothing asked why the number moved.
* ``check_doc_coherence.py``'s overlay check matched ``N overlays`` but not
  ``N overlay renders``, so two documents kept a stale count the check existed
  to catch.

Both are the same shape as the defects those gates hunt: **a control whose
scope is narrower than the surface it guards**. The difference is that the
gates announce their scope in their success line — so the narrowing is
measurable, if anything measures it.

How this works
--------------
Each gate is run, and the number it reports is compared against a recorded
floor. A floor is a **ratchet at the measured value**, exactly like
``fail_under`` for coverage: it costs nothing today, and it makes any later
shrinkage a failure rather than a smaller number nobody reads.

Growth is welcome and does not fail. Shrinkage fails, and the fix is either to
restore the scope or to lower the floor **deliberately**, in a diff someone
reviews.

The count is extracted with a per-gate pattern rather than "the first integer
in the line": ``check_gitleaks_pin`` reports a pinned version, ``8.30.1``,
whose leading 8 is not a scope at all.
