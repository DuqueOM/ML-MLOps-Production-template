# =============================================================================
# Per-service IRSA roles + narrow policies (PR-R2-6, audit R2 §3.4).
#
# This file implements the `runtime` identity of the ADR-017 5-identity
# split (ci / deploy / runtime / drift / retrain). The `runtime` IRSA
# is per-service rather than shared so a compromised service's token
# cannot move laterally. See iam-roles-split.tf for ci/deploy/drift/
# retrain (shared infrastructure identities).
#
# Each entry in var.service_names gets:
#   * an IAM role assumable by the K8s ServiceAccount of the same
#     name in namespace `ml-services`, via the EKS OIDC provider;
#   * an inline policy with the *minimum* permissions the template's
#     standard service shape needs:
#         - read on the data bucket (ingest features)
#         - read+write on the service's own model prefix in the
#           models bucket (write new artifacts, read on rollback)
#         - read+write on the mlflow_artifacts bucket (per-run
#           artefacts; tracking server is the source of truth)
#         - decrypt on the S3 SSE KMS key (so reads of encrypted
#           objects actually work)
#         - GetSecretValue on the service's secrets only
#
# Anti-patterns explicitly excluded:
#   * No `Action: "*"` and no `Resource: "*"` — both would defeat the
#     audit's narrow-IRSA requirement.
#   * No s3:DeleteBucket / s3:PutBucketPolicy — the role can write
#     OBJECTS, never reconfigure infrastructure.
#   * No iam:* — a compromised pod cannot self-elevate.
#
# To deploy a real service:
#   1. Add its name to var.service_names.
#   2. Annotate its K8s ServiceAccount:
#        eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: <output of this role's ARN>
# =============================================================================

# expects this exact form because the OIDC sub claim references
# "<host>:sub:system:serviceaccount:<ns>:<sa>".
