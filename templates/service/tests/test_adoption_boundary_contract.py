"""Contract test for ADR-016 PR-R2-12 — adoption-boundary doc + non-agentic on-ramp.

Three invariants:

1. **Maturity matrix is present** — `docs/ADOPTION.md` exists and contains a
   ratings table (ready/partial/roadmap) plus the canonical non-claims list.

2. **Every /slash workflow has a `make` equivalent** — for each file in
   `.windsurf/workflows/*.md`, the corresponding `make` target exists in
   `templates/Makefile`. The mapping is canonical (defined in this test);
   if a new workflow is added without a make target, this test fails.

3. **README points at ADOPTION.md** — the README has an "Adoption boundary"
   section that links to the doc; otherwise platform reviewers will miss it.

These three together prevent the agentic surface from quietly becoming
load-bearing: any new workflow must ship its non-agentic equivalent.

Authority: ADR-016 PR-R2-12.
