# Adoption Boundary & Non-Agentic On-Ramp

This document is the canonical answer to two questions a platform reviewer
asks when evaluating this template:

1. **"Is this ready for our org?"** — answered by the maturity matrix below.
2. **"Can my team adopt it without using AI agents?"** — answered by the
   make-target equivalents.

Authority: ADR-016 PR-R2-12.

## 1. Maturity matrix

Each capability is rated **per environment**. Definitions:

- **ready** — works out of the box after standard configuration; covered by
  contract tests; documented in a runbook
- **partial** — works but requires team-specific decisions or a follow-on PR
  before going live (see Notes column)
- **roadmap** — the template documents the intent and may include
  scaffolding, but you would build the production surface yourself

---

## 2. Non-agentic on-ramp

Every workflow we ship has either:

- a `make` target that runs the equivalent procedure end-to-end, or
- an explicit doc/runbook reference for the team to follow manually.

Teams that don't operate with AI assistants can adopt the template without
inheriting the agentic surface.

### Workflow → make-target / runbook map

| Slash workflow | Make equivalent | Runbook reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/new-service` | `make new-service NAME=<PascalCase> SLUG=<snake_case>` | `templates/scripts/new-service.sh --help` |
| `/scaffold-update` | `copier update` (manual) | `agentic/workflows/scaffold-update.md` |
| `/eda` | `make eda` (runs the 6-phase pipeline) | `eda/README.md` |
| `/drift-check` | `make drift-check` (runs `templates/service/scripts/drills/run_drift_drill.py`) | `docs/runbooks/drift-detection.md` |
| `/retrain` | `make retrain` (invokes training pipeline + quality gates) | `docs/runbooks/model-retrain.md` |
| `/load-test` | `make load-test` (Locust headless 60s) | `tests/load_test.py` docstring |
| `/release` | `make release-checklist` (prints the canonical checklist) | `docs/runbooks/release-checklist.md` |
| `/rollback` | `make rollback REV=<n>` (Argo Rollouts abort + kubectl undo) | `docs/runbooks/rollback.md` |
| `/incident` | `make incident-runbook` (prints incident response steps) | `docs/runbooks/incident-response.md` |
| `/performance-review` | `make performance-review` (sliced metrics + ground truth) | `docs/runbooks/performance-review.md` |
| `/cost-review` | `make cost-review` (cloud billing pull + budget compare) | `docs/runbooks/cost-review.md` |
| `/new-adr` | `make new-adr TITLE='<title>'` | `templates/service/docs/decisions/adr-template.md` |
| `/secret-breach` | `make secret-breach-check` (gitleaks scan) + escalation runbook | `docs/runbooks/secret-breach.md` |
| `/scaffold-update` | `make scaffold-update` (copier update) | `MIGRATION.md` |
| `/doc-coherence` | `make doc-coherence` (runs `scripts/check_doc_coherence.py`) | `agentic/skills/doc-coherence/SKILL.md` (rule 16, ADR-031) |
| `/stack-switch` | `make switch-profile PROFILE=local\|staging\|prod` | `agentic/skills/stack-switch/SKILL.md` (ADR-033) |
| `/onboard` | `make onboard` (copies `config/adopter_context.example.yaml`, prints the schema-validation command) | `agentic/skills/template-onboard/SKILL.md` (ADR-029 Wave 3) |
| `/ci-green` | `make ci-green REF=<branch-or-sha>` (lists workflow run status via `gh`) | `agentic/skills/ci-green-verify/SKILL.md` (D-36, ADR-039) |
| `/edge-setup` | `make edge-setup OVERLAY=<gcp-prod\|aws-prod\|...>` (renders the overlay, checks the edge-protection annotation) | `agentic/skills/edge-audit/SKILL.md` (D-38, ADR-042) |
| `/audit-quality` | `make audit-quality` (points to the enterprise-audit skill) | `agentic/skills/enterprise-audit/SKILL.md` (ADR-043) |
| `/document-changes` | `make document-changes` (points to the Agent-DocUpdater entry point) | `agentic/workflows/document-changes.md` (ADR-043) |

### Skill → CLI / runbook map

Skills are agent reasoning bundles, so their non-agentic equivalent is the
underlying CLI tool plus the corresponding human runbook:

| Skill | CLI / runbook |
| --- | --- |
| `new-service` | `templates/scripts/new-service.sh` |
| `scaffold-update` | `copier update` (manual; see `agentic/workflows/scaffold-update.md`) |
| `deploy-gke` / `deploy-aws` | `templates/service/scripts/deploy.sh` + `docs/runbooks/deploy-{gke,aws}.md` |
| `rollback` | `make rollback` + `docs/runbooks/rollback.md` |
| `drift-detection` | `templates/service/scripts/drills/run_drift_drill.py` + `docs/runbooks/drift-detection.md` |
| `model-retrain` | `make retrain` + `docs/runbooks/model-retrain.md` |
| `eda-analysis` | `eda/run_eda.py` + `eda/README.md` |
| `cost-audit` | `make cost-review` + `docs/runbooks/cost-review.md` |
| `security-audit` | `make security-audit` (gitleaks + bandit + trivy) |
| `secret-breach-response` | `make secret-breach-check` + `docs/runbooks/secret-breach.md` |
| `rule-audit` | `make audit-rules` (validates AGENTS.md invariants D-01..D-38 are documented) |
| `edge-audit` | `make edge-setup OVERLAY=<overlay>` (audits edge-protection coverage; D-38, ADR-042) |
| `doc-coherence` | `make doc-coherence` (cross-document coherence gate; rule 16, ADR-031) |
| `stack-switch` | `make switch-profile PROFILE=<local\|staging\|prod>` (ADR-033) |
| `template-onboard` | `make onboard` (ADR-029 Wave 3) |
| `enterprise-audit` | `make audit-quality` (23-domain audit procedure; ADR-043) |
| `debug-ml-inference` | `docs/runbooks/debug-ml-inference.md` (manual procedure; no CLI equivalent — pure RCA reasoning) |
| `performance-degradation-rca` | `docs/runbooks/performance-degradation-rca.md` (manual RCA procedure) |
| `concept-drift-analysis` | `make performance-review` + `docs/runbooks/concept-drift-analysis.md` |
| `release-checklist` | `make release-checklist` |
| `batch-inference` | `make batch-inference DATA=<path>` (target in the service `Makefile`) |

### Operational reality check

If your team adopts the template **without agents**, you lose:

- automatic mode escalation on incidents (`AUTO→CONSULT→STOP` — you decide
  manually based on the same signals from Prometheus)
- audit trail entry generation (you invoke `scripts/audit_record.py` from
  your runbooks instead of the agent doing it transparently)
- proactive risk-context queries before destructive operations

You **do not** lose:

- any of the production invariants (D-01..D-35 are codified in tests, not
  agent behavior)
- contract tests (run on every PR via the same CI workflows)
- supply-chain security (Cosign + SBOM + Kyverno are pipeline, not agent)
- monitoring / alerting / drift detection (CronJobs + Prometheus, not
  agents)
- 4-job deploy chain (GitHub Environments + reviewer approval, not agents)

The agentic surface is a **productivity multiplier** for teams that want
it; it is not a load-bearing component of the template's safety guarantees.

---

## 3. What this template does NOT claim

To prevent over-promising:

- **Multi-region active-active**: out of scope. The template assumes one
  active region per service per cloud. Cross-region failover is your
  organization's choice.
- **Compliance certifications**: SOC2, HIPAA, FedRAMP — these are
  organizational programs that consume the template's evidence (audit
  trail, signed images, RBAC) but aren't the template itself.
- **Zero-downtime database migrations**: out of scope. The template's
  4-job deploy chain handles stateless service rollouts; database schema
  evolution is your team's discipline.
- **Built-in feature store**: ADR-001 deferred this until 5+ services
  share features. PSI baselines + DVC remotes serve 2-3 services well.
- **Prompt engineering for LLM services**: this template targets
  classical ML serving (sklearn/XGBoost/LightGBM). LLM serving has
  different invariants (cold-start latency, token streaming, GPU pinning)
  not covered here.
- **Mobile / edge inference**: out of scope. The template assumes
  Kubernetes serving with HPA-driven horizontal scale.

If your use case lives in any of these gaps, the template is still useful
as a starting point, but expect to do additive work rather than just
configuration.

---

## 4. Portability & escape hatches (AUDIT R9-04)

The template is agnostic by design (GCP+AWS parity, sklearn/XGBoost/
LightGBM, a documented BentoML seam), but "agnostic" only helps an
architect if the swap cost is legible in advance. This matrix answers
"I want X instead — what do I touch, what stays the same?"

| Dimension | Default | Swap to | What you touch | What stays the same |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud | GCP (primary) + AWS parity | AWS-only, or GCP-only | Keep only one `infra/terraform/{gcp,aws}/` tree and the matching `k8s/overlays/{gcp,aws}/*`; drop the unused cloud's CI deploy job | Serving code, quality gates, monitoring stack, agentic surface — none of them import a cloud SDK directly |
| Tracking / registry | Self-hosted MLflow on K8s | Managed registry (Databricks, SageMaker, Vertex Model Registry) | `common_utils/model_persistence.py` load/save calls; `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`; the `mlflow.log_model` call sites in training | Quality-gate shape (metric + fairness DIR + leakage), promotion governance workflow |
| Serving backend | FastAPI + `ThreadPoolExecutor` (hand-rolled) | BentoML | Nothing shipped yet — ADR-032 is Phase 0 (invariant contract only); a `serving_backend` Copier choice is the documented Phase 1 seam | D-01/D-23/D-25 — the contract any backend must satisfy is written down in advance, not discovered by trial and error |
| Model framework | scikit-learn / XGBoost / LightGBM (tabular) | PyTorch / TensorFlow (tabular) | `src/<service>/models.py`, `training/train.py`; `KernelExplainer` stays valid for any `predict_proba`-shaped model | `/predict` + `/predict_batch` contract, quality gates, K8s manifests |
| Data validation | Pandera | Great Expectations or another schema tool | `common_utils/input_validation.py`, `app/_pandera_schema.py` | The second-wall-validation INVARIANT (D-14) — the library is swappable, the requirement that serving re-validates independently of training is not |
| Drift detection | PSI (quantile bins) | Evidently, whylogs, a vendor | `templates/service/scripts/drills/run_drift_drill.py` internals | CronJob wiring, alert routing, the closed-loop monitoring contract |
| Scaffolding engine | Copier | Cookiecutter (+ cruft) | `copier.yml` → `cookiecutter.json` rewrite | Nothing else survives cleanly — this is the one swap with a real, documented regression: native `copier update` 3-way merge is lost (ADR-030 §7 Alternatives) |
| IaC | Terraform | Pulumi / CDK | Full rewrite of `infra/terraform/{gcp,aws}/` | The module BOUNDARIES (network / compute / IAM split) as a design reference, not the HCL itself |
| Agentic host | Claude Code | Cursor / Devin / Codex CLI | Nothing — `agentic/` is the vendor-neutral canon (ADR-027); each host reads its own generated adapter | Everything — this row IS what ADR-027 exists to guarantee |

The pattern across every row: **the invariant is the contract; the
implementation behind it is the swappable part.** Rows without a shipped
swap path (BentoML Phase 1) are flagged as such rather than glossed over —
see the linked ADR for exactly what's proposed vs. built.

## 5. AI-specific governance frameworks

Section 6 below covers general enterprise security/privacy regimes (GDPR,
SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA). For frameworks specific to AI/ML systems — **NIST
AI RMF**, **ISO/IEC 42001**, and the **EU AI Act** — see
[`docs/COMPLIANCE_MAPPING.md`](COMPLIANCE_MAPPING.md) (ADR-038). Same
non-claim discipline applies: these are artifact-to-evidence mappings, not
certifications.

---

## 6. Compliance gap analysis

This section documents which controls in common compliance regimes the
template materially supports vs. those that are organizational and out
of scope. The template is **not certified** under any program; it
provides evidence that organizations can compose into their own audits.

Authority: R4 audit M4, ADR-020 §S2-2.

| §164.404 breach notification | Out of scope | None | Org-level breach response program |

### 6.5 Out-of-scope by template philosophy (ADR-001)

The template explicitly does **not** address:

- **PCI DSS** — payment card data should not transit a generic ML service.
  The template offers no specific PCI controls.
- **FedRAMP** — federal authorization requires hermetic builds (SLSA L3+),
  org-level personnel screening, and continuous monitoring beyond the
  template's scope.
- **HITRUST CSF** — derived framework; gaps inherited from §6.4 above.

### 6.6 How adopters use this analysis

1. Pick the regime your org targets.
2. For each "Covered" row, link the cited evidence file in your audit
   binder (`docs/runbooks/`, `ops/audit.jsonl`, contract test names).
3. For each "Partial" / "Out of scope" row, document the organizational
   process you have in place. The template does not pretend to cover it.
4. Re-run this analysis at every MAJOR release per `docs/RELEASING.md` —
   new contract changes can shift coverage.

---

## 7. Disclosure SLA (R4 audit M4 clarification)

The vulnerability response timeline in [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md)
is **operational** for this template:

- The maintainer commits to the response times listed (Critical 48h /
  High 7d / Medium 14d / Low 30d).
- The maintainer is a single individual and SLA depends on
  availability; for organizations adopting the template, **fork and
  assign internal maintainers** so the SLA is sized to your operational
  reality.
- Vulnerability findings that affect already-deployed adopters trigger a
  CVE assignment via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting before any
  public disclosure.
- After resolution, a redacted post-mortem is published in
  `docs/incidents/` (existing convention).
