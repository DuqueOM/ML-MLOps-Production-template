# ADR-027 — Vendor-Neutral Canonical Agentic Surface

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2026-06-08
- **Deciders**: Template maintainer (`@DuqueOM`)
- **Supersedes / amends**: Amends ADR-023 §3 invariant **I-4** (introduces
  *mirror-surfaces* alongside *pointer-surfaces*). Complements ADR-005
  (agent behavior), ADR-024 / ADR-025 (portability follow-ups).
- **Superseded by**: none
- **Related artifacts**:
  - `templates/config/agentic_manifest.yaml` — cross-surface index.
  - `scripts/sync_agentic_adapters.py` — renders surfaces from canonical.
  - `scripts/validate_agentic.py`, `scripts/validate_agentic_manifest.py`.

## 1. Context

On **2 June 2026** Cognition rebranded **Windsurf** to **Devin Desktop**
(over-the-air update; accounts, plans, extensions, keybindings preserved).
The in-editor agent **Cascade** is being replaced by **Devin Local** and is
**EOL on 1 July 2026** (source: official Devin Desktop FAQ,
`docs.devin.ai/desktop/devin-desktop-faq`).

The same FAQ defines, authoritatively, how the IDE now discovers
workspace agentic configuration:

- **Directory rules**: `.devin/rules/` is the **preferred** location and
  **takes precedence**; `.windsurf/rules/` is kept as a **backward-compat
  fallback**. Both are read.
- The IDE also reads `AGENTS.md` / `agents.md` and `.cursor/rules` (`.mdc`)
  as native rule sources.
- `.devin/{rules,workflows,skills,plans}/` and the `.windsurf/` equivalents
  are all read at the workspace level.
- There is **no** `.devinrules` single-file equivalent; `.windsurfrules`
  legacy still works.

When this repo was opened in Devin Desktop, the IDE proposed (and staged) a
pure rename `.windsurf/{rules,skills,workflows}/ → .devin/`. That move is
correct for the IDE, but it broke the template's **internal contract**:
ADR-023 made `.windsurf/` the *canonical authoritative surface* referenced
by the manifest, both validators, the adapter pointers, the context
pointers, and ~50 documentation/test files. After the rename, every
`source:` path in `agentic_manifest.yaml` pointed at a directory that no
longer existed, and `validate_agentic_manifest.py --strict` would fail.

The deeper problem is structural: **the canonical source of truth was named
after a vendor**. The rebrand is the second naming event in 14 months
(Codeium → Windsurf → Devin). Re-coupling the canonical store to `.devin/`
just resets the same time-bomb under a new name.

## 2. Decision

Introduce a **vendor-neutral canonical surface** and demote every
IDE-specific directory to a *generated surface*.

1. **Canonical body store → `agentic/{rules,skills,workflows}/`** (visible,
   top-level, human-authored, the only files humans edit). "Visible, not
   hidden" because this is first-class authored content — like `docs/`,
   `templates/`, and the already-visible `AGENTS.md` — not tool config. The
   name `agentic/` matches the established vocabulary (`agentic_manifest.yaml`,
   `docs/agentic/`, `validate_agentic.py`).

2. **`.devin/` becomes a generated *mirror-surface*** containing **full
   bodies** (not pointers), because Devin Desktop ingests directory content
   directly and does **not** read an arbitrary `agentic/` directory. `.devin/`
   is the preferred IDE location and has precedence per the FAQ.

3. **`.cursor/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/` remain *pointer-surfaces***
   (unchanged pattern): thin pointers back to `agentic/...` + `AGENTS.md`.

4. **`.windsurf/` is dropped.** Devin reads `.devin/` with precedence; the
   FAQ keeps `.windsurf/` only as a fallback for the deprecated client.
   Maintaining a third on-disk copy adds duplication without value. (Revisit
   trigger below if adopters still on legacy Windsurf report a gap.)

5. **`AGENTS.md` remains the sole authority** for invariants, modes,
   permissions, and handoffs — unchanged by this ADR.

### 2.1 Amendment to ADR-023 I-4

ADR-023 I-4 stated *"adapters are generated pointers, never forks."* This
ADR refines it: surfaces are generated from the canonical store and fall
into two kinds, declared per surface in the manifest via `kind:`:

| Surface kind | Content | Surfaces | Why |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------- | ----- |
| `canonical` | authored bodies | `agentic/` | single source of truth |
| `mirror` | generated full bodies | `.devin/` | IDE ingests bodies, can't follow pointers |
| `pointer` | generated thin pointers | `.cursor/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/` | tool can discover via reference |

The single-source-of-truth guarantee is **preserved** even though
`mirror` surfaces duplicate bytes, because:

- The sync script is the **only** writer of `.devin/` (and pointer surfaces).
- CI runs `sync_agentic_adapters.py --check`; any drift between `agentic/`
  and a generated surface **fails the build** (same discipline as generated
  code or lockfiles).
- Humans editing a `mirror` surface directly is a contract violation caught
  by CI, not a silent fork.

## 3. Invariants (contract-enforced)

- **I-027-1** — `agentic/{rules,skills,workflows}/` is the only canonical
  body store. Every manifest `source:` resolves there.
- **I-027-2** — `.devin/` content is byte-identical to the rendered output
  of `agentic/`. Enforced by `sync_agentic_adapters.py --check` in CI.
- **I-027-3** — pointer-surfaces (`.cursor/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`)
  reference both the canonical `source:` and `AGENTS.md`. Unchanged from
  ADR-023.
- **I-027-4** — no human edits a generated surface. The fix for any rule /
  skill / workflow change is to edit `agentic/...` then run sync.

## 4. Scope

**In scope** (this change):

- `agentic/` canonical store (moved from `.devin/` via `git mv`, preserving
  the rename chain `.windsurf → .devin → agentic`).
- Manifest: `source:` → `agentic/...`; `surfaces` gains `kind:` and a
  `canonical` + `devin` (mirror) entry.
- `validate_agentic.py`: scan `agentic/`.
- `validate_agentic_manifest.py`: validate mirror-surface body parity and
  the `.devin_context.md` pointer.
- `sync_agentic_adapters.py`: render mirror bodies into `.devin/`.
- Context pointers: add `.devin_context.md`; retire `.windsurf_context.md`.
- Contract tests updated to the new paths and the mirror/pointer split.
- Live references in code comments, docs, Makefiles, pre-commit, CI.

**Out of scope**:

- Rewriting historical ADRs (004, 005, 006, …). They are point-in-time
  records; their `.windsurf/...` references stand as written. Only ADR-023
  is amended (here) because it defines the live contract.
- Re-introducing `.windsurf/`. (Revisit trigger below.)
- Any change to `AGENTS.md` invariants, modes, or permissions.

## 5. Consequences

### Positive

- Canonical name survives the next rebrand: adding a future surface is a
  manifest entry + a sync backend, never a rename of the source of truth.
- "Tools adapt to our canon" is now structurally true and visible.
- CI-enforced parity means a vendor-renamed directory can never again
  silently diverge from the canon.

### Negative

- `.devin/` now duplicates bodies on disk (≈ 43 files). Mitigated: it is
  generated, CI-checked, and humans are told never to edit it.
- One more generated artifact in the tree. Mitigated by the `--check` gate.

### Neutral

- The IDE picks up `.devin/` exactly as before; interactive behavior is
  unchanged for users.

## 6. Revisit triggers

- **Adopters report Devin still reads `.windsurf/` in some flow** → add a
  second mirror-surface `windsurf` to the manifest; sync renders both.
- **A future IDE reads a neutral directory natively** → point it straight at
  `agentic/`, drop its mirror.
- **Cognition publishes a `.devinrules`/native pointer mechanism** → the
  `.devin/` mirror could shrink to a pointer; flip its `kind:` to `pointer`.
- **`.devin/` body drift appears in review** → tighten the CI `--check` to a
  required status, not advisory.

## 7. Alternatives considered

| Alternative | Why rejected |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Accept the rename: `.devin/` is canonical (Option A) | Re-couples the source of truth to a vendor name; repeats the exact failure this ADR removes |
| Keep `.windsurf/` canonical, treat Devin as one more adapter (Option B) | `.windsurf` is now a dead brand and Devin needs real bodies under `.devin/`, so a pointer adapter would not be ingested |
| Hidden `.agents/` as canonical | Demotes authored content to tool-config status; inconsistent with the visible `AGENTS.md` authority; introduces `agents` vs `agentic` vocabulary split |
| Symlink `.devin/ → agentic/` | Not portable to Windows (the template explicitly supports Windows in `validate_agentic.py`) |
