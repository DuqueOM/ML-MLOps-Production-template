"""Verify that requirements files installed into the SAME environment agree on pins.

Why this exists
---------------
A generated service ships more than one requirements file, and
``docs/TUTORIAL.md`` walks the adopter through installing several of them into
one environment. Nothing checked that they could coexist. They could not::

    ERROR: Cannot install scikit-learn~=1.5.0 and scikit-learn~=1.9 because
    these package versions have conflicting dependencies.
    ERROR: ResolutionImpossible

``templates/service/requirements.txt`` pinned ``scikit-learn ~= 1.5.0`` and
``pandera ~= 0.23.0``; ``templates/service/eda/requirements.txt`` pinned
``~= 1.9`` and ``~= 0.33``. pip does not error, because the tutorial installs
them in two separate commands — it silently *upgrades* the first set. So the
adopter trains a model against scikit-learn 1.9 and serves it from an image
built with 1.5.2. That is precisely the joblib version-skew failure the
``~=`` policy (D-05) exists to prevent, arriving through the one door nothing
was watching.

How it got there is the part worth designing against: Dependabot raised the
bump on both lanes. The EDA-lane PRs were merged (#116, #135) and the
service-lane PRs for the same packages were closed (#132, #134). Each decision
was defensible alone; together they opened a gap, and no gate compared the two
files, so the gap was invisible.

What this checks
----------------
1. **Pin coherence.** Within a co-installation group, a distribution declared
   in more than one file must carry a byte-identical specifier. Identical, not
   merely compatible: ``~=1.26`` (>=1.26,<2.0) and ``~=1.26.0``
   (>=1.26.0,<1.27.0) are both "numpy 1.x" to a reader and different resolvers
   to pip, and the looser one silently readmits the version the tighter one
   was written to exclude.

2. **Group membership is total.** Every tracked ``*requirements*.txt`` must
   belong to a declared group. A new requirements file cannot join the tree
   without a human deciding what it is installed alongside — otherwise this
   gate would narrow exactly the way the defects it hunts do, and would keep
   reporting OK at its smaller size.

What this deliberately does NOT check
-------------------------------------
Transitive resolvability. Two files can agree on every shared *direct* pin and
still conflict three levels down. Catching that needs a resolver and a network,
which the CI already spends once in
``scripts/resolve_python_dependencies.py``. This gate is the static, offline,
sub-second half: it catches the class that actually occurred, on every commit,
including pre-push.

Exit codes
----------
- 0: every co-installation group is internally coherent.
- 1: a group disagrees on a shared pin, or a requirements file belongs to no
  group.
